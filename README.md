# Welcome to my templates repo

Here I will share all the templates that I create in order to learn, practice, be faster and organize my ideas in projects that try to cover everything that anybody using those would need.

This repo is powered by [Turborepo](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo). I know that it is overkill, but I also wanted to practice monorepos and I plan on growing the list of templates anyway, so better safe than sorry.

## Tools

Most (if not all) of the projects inside are powered by [Next JS](https://github.com/vercel/next.js), the framework built on top of React. I really like the tool, it feels like having super powers.

However, I plan on learning other technologies like [Nuxt](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js) or [Remix](https://github.com/remix-run/remix) so there is a chance that I will be expanding the list even more.

## How to use

If the project gains enough traction, I will consider uploading these to the NPM registry so that they are easily accessible.

As of right now, you could clone this repo, and install the template that you like using [NPM Workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces), like this.

```bash
npm install -w templates/frontendstore
```

After that, you will need to navigate to the folder you installed:

```bash
cd templates/frontendstore
```

Once in the installed folder, run `npm run dev` to start a local server and explore the project

If you wish to install the whole project, in the root folder run `npm install` and then `npm run dev`. This will start a dev server for all of the projects inside.

## Contributing

I will be more than glad if anybody wants to say something about this template. I am a lifelong learner and I like listening to feedback. Reach me out on twitter at [@iamjmoa](https://twitter.com/iamjmoa)
