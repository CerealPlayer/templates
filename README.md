# Welcome to my templates repo

Here I will share all the templates that I create in order to learn, practice, be faster and organize my ideas in projects that try to cover everything that anybody using those would need.

This repo is powered by [Turborepo](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo). I know that it is overkill, but I also wanted to practice monorepos and I plan on growing the list of templates anyway, so better safe than sorry.

## Tools

Most (if not all) of the projects inside are powered by [Next JS](https://github.com/vercel/next.js), the framework built on top of React. I really like the tool, it feels like having super powers.

However, I plan on learning other technologies like [Nuxt](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js) or [Remix](https://github.com/remix-run/remix) so there is a chance that I will be expanding the list even more.

## How to use

As of right now, you could clone this repo, and install the template that you like using [NPM Workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces).

Or install the whole project. Run `npm install` and then `npm run dev`. This will start a dev server for all of the projects inside.

## Contributing

I will be more than glad if anybody wants to say something about this template. I am a lifelong learner and I like listening to feedback. Reach me out on twitter at [@iamjmoa](https://twitter.com/iamjmoa)
